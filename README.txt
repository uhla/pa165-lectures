Shared sources for SWI styling are in shared directory

use following at the top of presentations to apply styling

%apply styling
\input{../shared/SWIstyling}

See existing lectures for reference on how to use.

Note styling: currently there is issue with referencing correct path, make sure that each lecture has its dedicated directory (should be ../shared to access shared sources)
